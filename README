After installing the Manage Subsites module, follow the directions below to setup your server to allow subsites. In most cases a root users will need to do this, modifying the Web server's configuration to define a location for the ATutor main site, and define an ServerAlias.



1. Ensure your webserver has a virtual host setup to point to the main ATutor codebase. Something like the following with Apache. This is typically done by creating a new virtual host file within the Apache sites-available directory, linking the file into the sites-enabled directory, then restarting the Web server

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName  multi.mysite.com
        ServerAlias *.mysite.com

        # Indexes + Directory Root.
        DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
        DocumentRoot /var/www/sites/multi.mysite.com

        # Logfiles
        ErrorLog  /var/www/sites/logs/multi.mysite.com/errlog.log
        CustomLog /var/www/sites/logs/multi.mysite.com/acclog.log   Combined
</VirtualHost>


2. Once the Manage Subsites module is installed and enabled, change the ownership or permission of the shell script: [ATutor_root]mods/manage_multi/exec/make_multi.sh
to ensure it has write permission to the parent directory of [ATutor_root]. This user is typically the same user that owns ATutor itself. If you installed the module using the ATutor Module Manager from the public module repository, the systems's root user will need to make this permission change. If you uploaded the module manually and unpacked it on the server, then it is probably already owned by the same users that owns ATutor.

3. Go to the main site administrator's "Manage Subsites" page, then choose "Initial Configuration" and follow the instructions on the page to configure the database and mysql account that is used to create and manage subsites.

4. To create subsites, use "Manage Subsites" page -> "Create Subsite" page

5. To manage subsites, use "Manage Subsites" page -> "Manage Subsite" page
